Topic: School Diversity

Rationale School diversity is always an eye-attracting topic. In this research, what we are 
interested in is, if there is a real significant difference in school diversity and 
which factors lead to these differences. Firstly, we choose the Asian, Black and 
white variables to figure out the difference in proportion for different schools. 
In this case, we may do ANOVA analysis to see if there is a significant 
difference. Thereafter, we will choose the variable ST and d_locate_Txt as it 
includesthe characteristics about the schoolssuch asstate and (school district, 
town, rural, city, etc). We believe that both school size and type of school 
district will have a positive relationship to the school diversity. Hopefully, we 
can get some meaningful insights through this research.
